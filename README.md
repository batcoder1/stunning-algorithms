# Algorithms with Javascript

Classic algoritms are resolved using javascript

## Algorithms

### Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar or the number 10801

#### Reference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)


### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For example, the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4.

#### Reference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)


### Least Common Multiple (LCM)

In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple of two integers a and b, usually denoted by LCM(a, b), is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b.

#### Reference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple)


### Factorial

The factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,
  <p class="text-center"> 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120</p>

### Pythagorean Theorem
Is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a, b and c, often called the "Pythagorean equation":

### Reverse String 

Get the input string read from right to left


### Reverse Integer 

Get the input number read from right to left


### Maximum subarray problem

The maximum subarray problem is the task of finding a contiguous subarray with the largest sum, within a given one-dimensional array A[1...n] of numbers.
