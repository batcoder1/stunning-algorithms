# Algorithms with Javascript

Classic algoritms are resolved using javascript

## Algorithms

### Palindrome


### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)


### Least Common Multiple (LCM)


### Factorial

The factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,
  <p class="text-center"> 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120</p>

### Pythagorean Theorem
Is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a, b and c, often called the "Pythagorean equation":[1]

### Maximum subarray problem

The maximum subarray problem is the task of finding a contiguous subarray with the largest sum, within a given one-dimensional array A[1...n] of numbers.
